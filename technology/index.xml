      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its true. &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo; is an over-used industry buzz-word. But its real. And there are great insights to be gained from low-hanging Big Data business use-cases. Conventional or &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; business applications rely on structured data with predetermined links between data sets from different systems. For example, customer details in the online ecommerce system match up with customer details in the &amp;ldquo;service appointments&amp;rdquo; system. This kind of data is used in typical business analytics. But what about the click stream data of users, that may or may not be customers, who are browsing your marketing or ecommerce sites. Or data from underlying web servers which respond to resource requests before redirecting business-logic transactions to application servers. All these sub-systems produce data which is valuable when harvested intelligently and cost-effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
