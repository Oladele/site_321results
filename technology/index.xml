      <description>&lt;p&gt;Studies show about 30% of fatalities and 40% of serious injuries occur at intersections. Working with a major IOT platform provider in the US, we developed powerful smart city traffic simulation, which includes IOT sensors. Our smart city IOT simulation capabilities provides rich, dynamic, reliable IOT sensor events which can be used to demonstrate (and to build/test) capabilities of IOT roll-outs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conventional or &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; business applications rely on structured data with predetermined links between data sets from different systems. For example, customer details in your ecommerce system is linked, via a customer ID field, with customer details in you CRM. But what about web client and web server click stream data of users who may not be customers? These and other systems produce data which is valuable when harvested intelligently and cost-effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
